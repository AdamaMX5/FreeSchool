<h1>FreeSchool</h1>
<p>FreeSchool is a free online school that offers free courses to anyone who wants to learn. We offer courses in a wide range of topics, from computer programming to history to art. Our goal is to make high-quality education accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial situation.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install FreeSchool, simply download the latest version from our website or Github.
pip install fastapi[all] 
</p>

<h2>Run Backend</h2>
<p>Once you have installed FreeSchool, you can start the Server by:
uvicorn main:app --reload
</p>
<p>Or in PyCharm: you set up the debug mode:
    script: C:/Users/Kurt/Python/FreeSchool/main.py
    uvicorn main:app  --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --workers 1
</p>

<h2> Run Frontend</h2>
<p>To run the frontend, you can use the following command:
cd  C:\Users\Kurt\Python\FreeSchool\frontend>
npm run dev
</p>

<h2>Wenn die SQL Datenbank nicht aktuell ist nutze Alembic</h2>
<p>To update the SQL database, you can use Alembic. First, make sure you have Alembic installed:
pip install alembic
</p>
<p>Then, navigate to the directory where your Alembic configuration file is located and run the following command:
alembic upgrade head
</p>
<h3>Wenn wir die Modelle erweitert haben und noch keine version daf√ºr exsistiert</h3>
<p>To create a new migration script, you can use the following command:
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new models"
</p>
<p>This will create a new migration script in the migrations directory. You can then proof and edit the script to add your new models and run the upgrade command again.</p>
